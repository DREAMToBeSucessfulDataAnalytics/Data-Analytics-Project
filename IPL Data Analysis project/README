The dataset contains 2 files: deliveries.csv and matches.csv. The matches.csv contains details related to the match such as location, contesting teams, umpires, results, etc.
deliveries.csv is the ball-by-ball data of all the IPL matches including data of the batting team, batsman, bowler, non-striker, runs scored, etc.
